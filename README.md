# Independent-Component-Analysis

ICA is used for seperating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents by primary assumption of sources are non gaussian and statistically independent.

It is a special case of BSS (Blind Source Separation) and the goal is to decompose a multivariate signal into its independent non gaussian.

### Usage

- python ica.py <observed1.wav> <observed2.wav>

### Result

There will be a folder created in current directory "ICA Components", which contains the individual sources and plots for reference.
